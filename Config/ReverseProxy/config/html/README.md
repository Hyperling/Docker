# HTML Sites
If the reverse proxy also serves static HTML sites, the root directories of each can be placed here.
Then in conf.d may add a file which points the domain to the HTML web root, such as `/etc/nginx/html/www.website.name`.

TODO Create an example file for this, such as `example.html.com`.
