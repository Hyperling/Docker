# Local DNS
Host a local DNS server in case your router/gateway is not cutting it. Allows
the ability to use simple names across the network witrhout editing `/etc/hosts`
on each machine. The IP of this server should be added to the router/gateway's
settings so that all machines on the network know to use it and can benefit.
