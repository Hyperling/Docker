# This has not helped, not sure why containers are not uing hosts's DNS, or why
#  the requests are failing. Needs further research/testing but works on Ubuntu
#  laptop, just not Debian VM. VM can use the DNS server properly though.
### # If you have both Nextcloud and OnlyOffice on the same internal network you
### #   will likely want to set this to an internal DNS server. Some routers will
### #   drop traffic if an internal IP tries to communicate with the WAN IP, causing
### #   the curl to OnlyOffice's /healthcheck to fail. Do the same in both configs.
